# Facial Recognition on Embedded System
Developed a human facial recognition based on embedded system, collaborated with Fiona Huang. <br>
The facial recognition model was pre-trained to recognize my partner Fiona and I in a few time. <br>
If it detected any human face, a blue square will block the face, and show the human features right away. <br>


## Environment
- Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04

## How to start
- First, clone the folder and set up the Ubuntu environment, webcam, and the board.
- Duplicate the executable file to the board, be aware of the path you stored.
- Start the board, execute the file and you will get a real-time facial tracker on youe screen :)
